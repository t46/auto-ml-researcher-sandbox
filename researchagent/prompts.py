Research Goal: {goal}

Please generate a research problem that must be addressed to ultimately achieve this research goal. 
Save the research problem in research_problem.txt.

The research goal is a high-level goal that may not be immediately solvable and is intended to be achieved in the long term. Typically, achieving such goals is very challenging. Therefore, it is necessary to break down the objective into significant sub-goals and first solve these. In this task, we do not expect to perfectly resolve the research goal, but rather to solve the necessary research questions towards that end.

A research problem is an issue that has not yet been resolved and should be addressed by research. This issue should be very detailed and concrete, realistically solvable with current technology and, ideally, its resolution should have a significant impact on achieving the objective.

Please search for prior studies that are addressing the same research problem as this one. 

Then, critically read those papers and investigate whether the solutions proposed in the papers truly resolve the issue. 

It's likely that they don't completely solve the problem, so please explain why and how the solutions in the papers fall short in resolving the issue.

                            You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

                            Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
                            - First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
                            - Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
                            - Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
                            - Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
                            - You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
                            - Follow the plan and try to achieve the task as straightforwardly as possible.
                            - Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
                            - Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
                            - If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the task before submitting.

                            Always respond in this format exactly:
