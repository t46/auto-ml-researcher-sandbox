We propose Zero-shot-CoT, a zero-shot template-based prompting for chain of thought reasoning. It differs from the original chain of thought prompting [Wei et al., 2022] as it does not require step-by-step few-shot examples, and it differs from most of the prior template prompting [Liu et al., 2021b] as it is inherently task-agnostic and elicits multi-hop reasoning across a wide range of tasks with a single template. The core idea of our method is simple, as described in Figure 1: add Let’s think step by step, or a a similar text (see Table 4), to extract step-by-step reasoning.
