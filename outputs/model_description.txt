We experiment with 17 models in total. Main experiments are conducted with InstructGPT3 [Ouyang et al., 2022] (text-ada/babbage/curie/davinci-001 and text-davinci-002)3 , original GPT3 [Brown et al., 2020] (ada, babbage, curie, and davinci)4 , and PaLM [Chowdhery et al., 2022] (8B, 62B, and 540B). In addition, we used GPT-2[Radford et al., 2019], GPT-Neo[Black et al., 2021], GPT-J[Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021], T0 [Sanh et al., 2022], and OPT [Zhang et al., 2022] for model scaling study. The size of LMs ranges from 0.3B to 540B. We include both standard (e.g. GPT-3 and OPT), and instruction following variants (e.g. Instruct-GPT3 and T0). See Appendix A.3 for model description details. Unless otherwise stated, we use text-davinci-002 throughout the experiments.
