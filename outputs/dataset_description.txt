For arithmetic reasoning, we consider the following six datasets: (1) SingleEq [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2015], (2) AddSub [Hosseini et al., 2014], (3) MultiArith [Roy and Roth, 2015], (4) AQUARAT [Ling et al., 2017], (5) GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021], and (6) SVAMP [Patel et al., 2021]. The first three are from the classic Math World Problem Repository [Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016], and the last three are from more recent benchmarks. SingleEq and AddSub contain easier problems, which do not require multi-step calculation to solve the tasks. MultiArith, AQUA-RAT, GSM8k, and SVAMP are more challenging datasets that require multi-step reasoning to solve. 

For commonsense reasoning, we use CommonsenseQA [Talmor et al., 2019] and StrategyQA [Geva et al., 2021]. CommonsenseQA asks questions with complex semantics that often require reasoning based on prior knowledge [Talmor et al., 2019]. StrategyQA requires models to infer an implicit multi-hop reasoning to answer questions [Geva et al., 2021].

For symbolic reasoning, we use Last Letter Concatenation and Coin Flip [Wei et al., 2022]. Last letter Concatenation asks the model to concatenate the last letters of each word. We used randomly selected four names for each sample. Coin Flip asks the model to answer whether a coin is still heads up after people either flip or do not flip the coin. We created samples of four times flip or not flip trials. Although these tasks are easy for humans, LMs typically exhibit a flat scaling curve. 

For other logical reasoning tasks, we choose two evaluation sets from the BIG-bench effort [Srivastava et al., 2022]: Date Understanding 2 and Tracking Shuffled Objects. Date Understanding asks models to infer the date from a context. Tracking Shuffled Objects tests a modelâ€™s ability to infer the final state of objects given its initial state and a sequence of object shuffling. We used a dataset of tracking three shuffled objects for our experiment.
